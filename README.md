¨Hello World¨ I am not really new to GH but I am new to actually managing any 
repos or gits online. 

I enjoy a fair amount of ¨learning" it comes to any sodtware 
recently i have crossed over into the wild unknowns of hardware on a vendor or developer 
level. 

To that end I have managed to fill many devices with useful software packages or 
programs and i always wind up scrolling the archives here. 

I will be attempting to 
repackage or rather reorganize a fair amount of theese archives in an effort to provide 
a ¨consice¨ list or at the very least a comprehensive software guide to several items.

The focus of my work and yes i know it is sometimes the grey area we all love so much is:


1:  ROOTING 
2:  JAILBREAKING
3:  DECODING
4:  ETHICAL EXPLOTATION and TOOLS THERIN
5:  ETHICAL NETWORK MON AND EXPLOITATION
6:  ETHICAL HARDWARE EXPLOITATION
7:  ETHICAL SOFTWARE EXPLOITS
8:  ETHICAL INFORMATION GATHERING AND PROTECTORATE
9:  REPAIRS AND UPGRADES on HW and SW
10: BOOTLOADER DEVELOPMENT
11: API DEVELOPMENT
12: APP DEVELOPMENT
13: AFFILIATE MARKETING
14: WEB SERVER HOSTING AND DEV
15: WEB SITE DEV
16: CODING
17: SCRIPTING
18: NETWORK MANAGMENT AND RESOURCES
19: IT IN GENERAL
20: MOBILE PHONE DEV REPAIR AND REPURPOSE
21: OPERATING SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGMENT
22: ANY OTHER TOPIC THAT YOU CAN THINK OF RELATING TO THE ETHICAL YET GREY AREA OF ¨WORKAROUND¨S


So If you have any noteworhty packages or would like to assist me in this attempt to 
provide an acurate and comprehensive list of available software packages girs or repos or 
anything else you can think of that falls in the above catagories even if the origional
intent of the creator was not for an ethical purpose it is still worth including if its 
possible especially if the soure is available for it as it can be used in an ethicle 
manner to thwart or prevent mallicious attacks of that kind in the furutre as well as
many many other gainfuly and ethicaly employable means then please read below and then 
reply to me via the posted contact information following.
